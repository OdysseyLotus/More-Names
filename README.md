## You must install and overwrite manually. Subscribing will not do anything. Sorry, but as of now, there isn't any other way to mod this in.

This mod expands the available names for citizens, businesses, and cities.
* It at least triples the name count for Chinese, Eastern European, Hispanic, Japanese, Korean, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Native American, North American, Scandinavian, and Western European names.
* Adds more adjective and nouns for businesses and cities.
* Adds more names for cities (both Western and Eastern).

**Installation**
* Open the Shadows of Doubt game folder.
* Drag the "Shadows of Doubt_Data" folder from the zip to the game.
* When asked, overwrite the files.
* Done!

It is a good idea to back up your English localization folder before you install! If you don't you can uninstall and reinstall to remove the mod. Sorry, but there isn't a good way to mod in more names without overwriting game files right now.

As said above, subscribing to this mod will not do or break anything, but it might be a good idea to do so to keep track of what you have installed and if this mod has updated.
